# The NOVA System
Haha meme funny $x^2+2x+1=0$ is a qaudratic equation rendered with inline math ($). 

OOh goody I can do display math with "$$" signs.

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

>blockquotes are good

Let's use trial and error to see which numbers are factors of 51   
  
It's odd so we only need to try odd numbers:   
* 1 is a factor: $51 = 1 \times 51$   
* 3 is a factor: $51 = 3 \times 17$   
* 5 is not a factor   
* 7 is not a factor   
* 9 is not a factor   
     
And $9^2$ is already larger than $51$, so we don't need to try any more.   
The largest prime factor we found was $17$.
