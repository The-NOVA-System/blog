# Lesson Researching and Planning
This is just a quick check in to detail my progress writing the script for each of the lessons. As aforementioned, we decided to focus on four topics in our four different lessons. Our four main topics will be cryptocurrency (covering what it is, how it works, what’s been happening with cryptocurrency recently), blockchain (its practical uses, how it works, why it’s so useful), the economy (a full breakdown on how it works), and flutter (our experience developing the app in flutter, a relatively new coding language).

Over the past week I have been researching to find suitable definitions and analogies to explain cryptocurrencies and the various topics we have covered. This process has been going fairly smoothly, and I have also decided to mention some of crypto’s prevalence in the news recently in order to get people interested in what’s happening around them. So far, I am yet to find a way to integrate the app into the lesson format other than the lessons that talk about the development of the app, but in time I will find a way to properly integrate it into the lessons, in the hope that people will continue to use the app in their free time due to its easy interface and competitive nature (specifically related to the evolution of the leader-board and the large amount of people that will hopefully be using our app.
