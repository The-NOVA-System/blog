# 9th November??? 2021 (Nova system)
I forgot the date but we managed to get the web version of NOVA running for everyone. This was great progress and we started letting people get accounts in order to Beta test the app. What was interesting was that duplication glitches were found almost instantly which was fun but also possibly “game breaking” so we had to identify the root cause of these and patch them lest the leader board feature that had been implemented becomes obsolete because of the number of people who had money in the trillions by taking unfair advantage of the app.
