# Badge Idea
Today i came up with this idea to have achivement badges that are connected to each persons profile. 
For example if you reached 100,000 dollars of networth via investing youd get a badge that signifies it or a badge that signifies that you have invested everything you got directly into doge coin everytime. This would also give Beta testers a increased drive to test the app as we are considering giving them a special beta tester badge that they can wear on their profile. <br><br>

The Badges would most likely be automatically added to each persons profile as picking and chosing which to display would be tedious code wise and it would just be easier to have that data saved as soon as the goal is reached. With adding Badges however a page where all the badges that are obtainable are displayed probably has to be added. In my opinion the best place to do this would be ain the options drop down menu. More updates on Badges will come soon so please sit tight. Thank you.
