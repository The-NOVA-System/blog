# 18th November 2021 (more script work)
I am pretty sure we are set on the script now I added a bit yesterday as well and ordered the paragraphs so they make more sense. I believe this weekend we will start working on the community project presentation script and powerpoint (I believe Garv has stared work on the powerpoint already)

App was put on the Appstore recently wooo and wevee been getting downloads which is nice(from the school community since people cant really access it without a school email)
