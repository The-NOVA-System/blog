# 15th May 2021 (origin story)

(This is being written retroactively as when I sent this message to Garv the fact that we had to write process). On this day I got the idea to send a message to Garv (“For the year nine thing we could try and make an eco friendly crypto currency”, with the typo included) regarding a community project idea. At this point in time the community project was only first announced and we did not know any of the specifics such as needing to have a mentor and the fact we needed to keep our progress written and recorded in the form of a process journal ect. I honestly have no idea why I chose this idea even when I did at the time. I guess I wanted to have a tech related community project as tech is one of my passions and I was interested in crypto currencies at the time, especially how they are mined as well the economic damage it causes due to the computer using a lot of electricity and the electricity coming from coal fire-plants. I also thought this project would be fun in that we would not be able to achieve our goal instantly, rather it would be a rather slow but equally rewarding journey.
