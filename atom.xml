&lt;h1 id=&quot;18th-november-2021-more-script-work&quot;&gt;18th November 2021 (more script work)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure we are set on the script now I added a bit yesterday as well and ordered the paragraphs so they make more sense. I believe this weekend we will start working on the community project presentation script and powerpoint (I believe Garv has stared work on the powerpoint already)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
App was put on the Appstore recently wooo and wevee been getting downloads which is nice(from the school community since people cant really access it without a school email)&lt;/p&gt;

As mentioned, before I think  in one of my other journal entries Mr Heinrich provided this template and boy is it good. Its both professional and versatile and I really like how it looks.

&lt;!-- End Jekyll SEO tag --&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-been-a-while-again&quot;&gt;It’s been a while (again)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one of those rare times again that I write a blog post (woo)! At first, it was because I took a break from the project for 
like a week, and then it was because I hadn’t done enough work, and then small things started pilling up and I had done enough work, 
but I would write a blog post laterrrr, and before I know it, I’ve essentially finished the app and haven’t written anything in a month lmao.&lt;br /&gt;
No, but seriously, there’s been a lot of progress, much of which I haven’t covered in the slightest, so get some popcorn ready, cause this is gonna be a lot &amp;gt;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;login-systemfirebase&quot;&gt;Login System/Firebase&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the first things that I worked on after the last post was a login system. I spent quite some time designing a mockup
(thank you open source github repos), and I ended up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;MacOS Screenshot&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;iOS Simulator Recording&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/macos_login_screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;login screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;/blog/static/ios_login_sim.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt; &lt;/video&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I believe that the design above looks a lot better than what we ended up with, but the problem was that it just wasn’t dynamic enough, and with 
all the different screen sizes we intended to support (along with the difference between login and signup), it ended up not looking great. This coupled with 
the fact that we had to remove the google and facebook buttons (as per mr heinrich’s request), made it look a bit clunky, so I switched to a more minimal system 
which works well with firebase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/final_login.png&quot; alt=&quot;final login&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; look a lot more simple, but honestly it works better, and the login system will be redesigned eventually anyways, since once the 
beta testing is over, I’m going to open it to the public instead of just out school. Besides that, the login system is really cool, and links 
the app to our firebase database which is where all the transactions happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;small-things-make-a-whole&quot;&gt;Small things make a whole&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of these few weeks, there’s been a lot of small things that I’ve fixed that have added up to make the app a bit more than a small bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dropdown-menu&quot;&gt;Dropdown Menu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there’s a little dropdown menu to select a timeframe for the data. The graphs don’t update yet, but that’s because the graphs in a smaller timeframe 
kind of look crap with the Nomics API. Their sparkline endpoint became depreciated while I was using it, and the other historical crypto data has become 
part of the paid plan, which means that no matter what, charts taken from Nomics won’t really look &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt;. Eventually, I wanna shift to some other chart provider, 
which isn’t great because it means I have &lt;strong&gt;another&lt;/strong&gt; dependency, but it’s better than having less than ideal graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leaderboards&quot;&gt;Leaderboards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another “small” thing is the leaderboards, which are a cool addition. Originally, I was using a bucket sort for the values, but that screwed up with decimals and which multiple duplicates, 
so I ended up realising I could just use Dart’s built-in sort method which was cool. I also made the profile pictures load from &lt;a href=&quot;https://avatars.dicebear.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, 
which is a really cool API that generates unique default profile pictures so that everyone is special!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/leaderboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;leaderboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;password-reset-system&quot;&gt;Password Reset System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-explanatory ngl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cors-proxy&quot;&gt;CORS Proxy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, besides a few more formatting changes to make the app look a bit better, I made a CORS proxy, which was an attempt to bypass some school Wi-Fi blockages (I had permission don’t worry). 
Basically, I realised that the icons wouldn’t load on the web due to CORS (godamn it, it’s always CORS isn’t it), and the people at Nomics (who had previously given me CORS Passthrough for the normal API) 
said that they wouldn’t be able to give me passthrough for the AWS assets, advising me to use a CORS Proxy instead. I did as they said, and it worked well for a while, until I realised that 
the school blocked almost all CORS proxies I could find online (sadge). This resulted in me talking to Mr Heinrich and Mr McCarthy (see email below) about what could be done to fix this, and Mr McCarthy said 
I could just build my own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/cors_ss.png&quot; alt=&quot;CORS Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, needless to say, I did, and you can view it &lt;a href=&quot;https://corsproxy.garvshah.workers.dev&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; :D&lt;br /&gt;
It’s not exactly ideal since I’m on the cloudflare workers’ free plan, which means that if a lot of people start using the app then the icons will stop loading, but it’s fine for now. 
I plan to stop supporting the websit eventually anyways, since it’s so buggy :P &lt;br /&gt;
On that note: Linux and Windows builds don’t work anymore, since FlutterFire doesn’t support either of the platforms, which is a shame. Hopefully that gets fixed eventually. 
I’m keenly keeping my eyes on (this)[https://github.com/invertase/flutterfire_desktop] repo, which may be an eventual desktop implementation, which’d be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;buysell-system&quot;&gt;Buy/Sell System&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Wallets (Sell) Screen&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Buy Screen&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/wallets.png&quot; alt=&quot;login screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/buy.png&quot; alt=&quot;login recording&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty big thing that was added was the buy/sell system. This is basically the final building block in making the minimum viable version of the app, 
and minimum it definitely is. Currently, there are no transaction fees, you can only purchase using USD, and there are no withdrawal at all. Really, I just made 
it as quick as possible to get it out there, since it’s better to have a working version on the app store with updates pushed afterwards than to have nothing at all. 
Also, when we started beta testing, a couple of dupe glitches were discovered, which were fun to fix. 
I’m definitely going to work on this later (hopefully before the workshops, which were confirmed to be during the end of year program btw), and it’ll be improved once the app is on 
the app store. Speaking of which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;app-store-submission&quot;&gt;App Store Submission!!!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooo, we’ve got an app store submission! Apple was being a bit slow on the email game, and they didn’t reply to me very quickly, so even though I could’ve gotten 
the one free year of apple dev through my Apple Scholarship, it was better to get the submission done soon, so we just bought it. I’ve been going through the process 
of submitting and reviewing and so forth, and I’m still waiting to get it on the store. The following is a screenshot of the rejected Mac app for the app store:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/mac_deny.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, it’s been pretty cool using TestFlight to beta test the app, and we’ve gotten quite a few people on the app just testing stuff out. 
Here’s a link to join the beta (note that you gotta have a cgs email to make an account):
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://testflight.apple.com/join/RrZvlZS9&quot;&gt;https://testflight.apple.com/join/RrZvlZS9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve also got continuous delivery set up with the iOS app, and we have a pretty active userbase of friends who are just helping us 
iron out bugs before we release :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is nearly done, and a lot of it will just be polishing it out with little features here and there that make using the app a more pleasant experience. 
Honestly, we’re pretty close to the workshops, which means the end of this project at least in an official manner, so I most likely won’t get all of these implemented 
ever, but it’s nice to have them listed if I ever do get back to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just a little bug where you can scroll on the app bar, should be an easy fix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving the buy/sell system to make it more realistic with the ability to trade any crypto with fees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An improved login system with providers like google or github, apple sign in would be cool too&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Natsuki’s suggestion: badges for beta testers and developers and stuff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A buy me a coffee section in the about page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A search function to filter through the cryptos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A detailed view on profiles to be able to see what assets they have&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved graphs that actually change their timeframe and don’t look trash (probably not with Nomics)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to change your profile picture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding a few easter-eggs for fun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows and Linux Apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the list is pretty long, so hopefully it’s more like a checklist for whenever I get to it :D
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for reading. Have a good day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;looking-ahead-whats-going-on&quot;&gt;Looking ahead, what’s going on?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the End of Year Program just over a month away, we have plenty of time to polish off the app by adding a few key features and bug testing, as well as finalising our lesson scripts and presentation. A few of the key features we as a group would like to implement are custom badges and an achievement-based system (fuelling competitiveness and getting people even more involved in the app), a more nuanced user interface which makes buying and selling more streamlined, and a profile menu so people can see what other people have invested in.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s quite easy to see that we have all become quite attached to this project, and don’t plan on letting it up after this year is over. Our plan is to continue working on the app and getting it to more people, perhaps through the use of social media or other ways. Regardless, we really believe in this app, and think it has the potential to go far beyond our school community. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’m really excited to begin more proficient in Flutter (my personal coding knowledge doesn’t extend much past basic HTML) and helping Garv develop the app, so that we can all keep working on this in coming months and maybe years. We already have a great foundation to make this app really special – a great user interface and seamless API integration, but the app could still use some refining and polishing, specifically in migrating most of the data to firebase so we can live-update and alleviate some of the performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;badge-idea&quot;&gt;Badge Idea&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today i came up with this idea to have achivement badges that are connected to each persons profile. 
For example if you reached 100,000 dollars of networth via investing youd get a badge that signifies it or a badge that signifies that you have invested everything you got directly into doge coin everytime. This would also give Beta testers a increased drive to test the app as we are considering giving them a special beta tester badge that they can wear on their profile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Badges would most likely be automatically added to each persons profile as picking and chosing which to display would be tedious code wise and it would just be easier to have that data saved as soon as the goal is reached. With adding Badges however a page where all the badges that are obtainable are displayed probably has to be added. In my opinion the best place to do this would be ain the options drop down menu. More updates on Badges will come soon so please sit tight. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lesson-researching-and-planning&quot;&gt;Lesson Researching and Planning&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick check in to detail my progress writing the script for each of the lessons. As aforementioned, we decided to focus on four topics in our four different lessons. Our four main topics will be cryptocurrency (covering what it is, how it works, what’s been happening with cryptocurrency recently), blockchain (its practical uses, how it works, why it’s so useful), the economy (a full breakdown on how it works), and flutter (our experience developing the app in flutter, a relatively new coding language).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the past week I have been researching to find suitable definitions and analogies to explain cryptocurrencies and the various topics we have covered. This process has been going fairly smoothly, and I have also decided to mention some of crypto’s prevalence in the news recently in order to get people interested in what’s happening around them. So far, I am yet to find a way to integrate the app into the lesson format other than the lessons that talk about the development of the app, but in time I will find a way to properly integrate it into the lessons, in the hope that people will continue to use the app in their free time due to its easy interface and competitive nature (specifically related to the evolution of the leader-board and the large amount of people that will hopefully be using our app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;quick-update&quot;&gt;Quick Update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, i just wanted to make this small blog post in order to have an update on the current MacOS build that is going on. 
Right now Garv is building the softwear on his MacBook Air, honestly i am quiet suprised that it is working as it has 8Gb of ram which is enough for a school but 
usually isnt enough for softwear building, for example Andriod OS usually takes around 52Gb of ram in order to be able to build it. I suggested getting it built on Liam’s
desktop computer which is quiet beefy but that idea was shot down as the dev tools take around 400GB of storage and would take around “40 hours to transfer”(Garv) to Liam’s PC.
Last time i checked with Garv the build was due to be completed in roughly 40 hours which will be great to take for a spin after it has been built as it would probably solve the webapp’s
issue of running into errors when trying to load assets sometimes when the option to buy or to look at your perasonal wallet is changed too quickly. Expect another update on this topic soon,
maybe when it has finished building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;9th-november-2021-nova-system&quot;&gt;9th November??? 2021 (Nova system)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot the date but we managed to get the web version of NOVA running for everyone. This was great progress and we started letting people get accounts in order to Beta test the app. What was interesting was that duplication glitches were found almost instantly which was fun but also possibly “game breaking” so we had to identify the root cause of these and patch them lest the leader board feature that had been implemented becomes obsolete because of the number of people who had money in the trillions by taking unfair advantage of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;trying-to-find-a-time-to-host-our-lessons&quot;&gt;Trying to find a time to host our lessons&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having effectively created a useful teaching resource by way of the app, and written all our lessons, we as a group approached Mr Hamilton following a comprehensive Middle School Committee meeting (which coincidentally was about brainstorming ideas for the end of year program, the three days at the end of year when students in the middle school get to participate in activities of their choice). Our initial plan was to host lessons during Middle School Assembly periods, which would have been ideal because we wanted to break our lessons up into different sections pertaining to the different areas of the lessons, but unfortunately staying in remote learning for an extended part of the second half of this year prohibited this from happening, and upon our return to school middle school assembly periods were already blocked up. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a possibility to host our lessons during remote learning, but we feel that we wouldn’t have been able to provide the same engaging lesson experience over an online medium, since we wanted a large part of these workshops to be discussion-based and us going around and helping people out. Therefore, we managed to find a compromise with Mr Hamilton; that we could host our lessons during the End of Year Program. Unfortunately that meant we would have to condense a series of lessons into a shorter 2-hour period, but at least we were going to have a chance for people to experience our workshops in person. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the day, we were quite happy to have been able to make this compromise – the End of Year Program still being a month and a bit away gives us a fair bit more time than we originally thought to finalise the app and lessons, and we still have plenty of time to cover all the content that we want to. Actually, having the programs in the last week of school increases the probability of people coming, because in the tumultuous few last weeks of school, people are going to prioritise getting their work done, and potentially either forget about our sessions or disregard them for more time to get stuff done. With everything finished up, people will be able to kick back and enjoy our lessons.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After our initial discussion with Mr Hamilton, he asked us to put together an official application into the end of year program, which I’ve attached below:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hi Mr Hamilton,
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you’ve had a nice afternoon. As we’ve already discussed, my Community Project group (Garv Shah, Natsuki Rogers and myself) would like to host our in-person lessons/seminars about cryptocurrency and forms of investing during the end of year program. We’ve already seen a large group of students interested in both the topic and in taking the lessons (link to survey results conducted earlier this year), and have begun to formulate our lesson plans and teaching resources (shown below). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Teaching resource&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our teaching resource, for use as a practical demonstration of the knowledge in our lessons, is a simulated trading experience using virtual “money” to give people the experience of investing in cryptocurrencies, similar to the ASX Trading Game held earlier this year. If you would like to try the *work in progress* online version, create an account with your school email and a password of your choice; https://the-nova-system.github.io/nova_app/. 
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lesson plans&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our lessons aim to educate students about cryptocurrencies and the technologies that support them, both topics that have become increasingly prevalent as of late despite not many people knowing how they actually work. We will be advising students about the dangers of investing in such a volatile sector, and not providing any financial advice per se, rather educating people about what cryptocurrencies are and how they are traded. Our lessons include analogies about how cryptocurrencies work to make it simple for anybody interested to understand, talk about some of crypto’s prevalence in the news lately and how it’s impacting our society, a broader breakdown of how regular investing and the economy work, the benefits of cryptocurrency over traditional currency, and the technological advancements made through blockchain. Hopefully these will give students a proper and balanced insight into the wider topics around cryptocurrency.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank-you for considering our project idea as an event for the End of Year Program.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kind regards,
&lt;br /&gt;
Liam Shaw&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, our application went through and we now have the clear to host our lessons during the End of Year Program!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5th-november-script-writing&quot;&gt;5th November Script Writing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we built it into a proper script(it still needs some work) which is here, unfortunately we have been informed that u our original plan of having multiple lessons during various middle school assembly periods is not possible as they have all been booked out with important things so we have had to compromise and have it in the end of year program which means less time for the lessons as it has to be condensed into one session, but also more fun as in my opinion these sessions will be a lot less formal then they would’ve been. ( I did try and upload photos rather than text of the script so far but it did not work. Huge thanks to Liam who helped massively with the script here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-07/el-salvador-adopts-bitcoin-crypocurrency-as-legal-tender/100441472
https://finbold.com/guide/cryptocurrency-trading/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets begin this lesson with a few fun facts
Cryptocurrencies are pretty crazily popular at the moment. You’ve probably seen a fair bit of the news going around recently. Here are a couple of news items from this year which might peak your interest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has been accepted as a legal currency in a few different countries around the world, meaning people can use it day-to-day at restaurants and hotels or whatever. El Salvador was the first to officially make Bitcoin a legal currency, which we’re all pretty sure is just a cover for elaborate money-laundering through their corrupt government, but regardless the transition has gone pretty smoothly for your average Joe who wants to pay for his coffee with his phone on this lovely morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a massive shut-down of crypto-mining in China, mostly related to Bitcoin, and over the course of this year provincial bans have stopped about 90% of crypto mining in order to attempt to have greater control over their economy, with big players trying to find other places in the world with cheap electricity to power their mining needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been on social media recently, you’ve probably heard of the hit new TV show “Squid Game”. Some crypto afficionados saw their chance and creating a pretty sketchy Squid Game cryptocurrency, advertising it across the internet. Big surprise, the whole thing turned out to be a scam, with thousands of investors losing out after, just like in the show, only one person, (in this case the original creators), ran off with millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit closer to home, Australia’s big banks are starting to incorporate cryptocurrency trading into their own apps, which means we’re just that little bit closer to using them in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get in depth about crypto, lets outline what a currency is in general
Before we can go onto different types of currencies we first have to go over what a currency is. Well a currency is a monetary system that is used, usually in a country, but what is money? A good surface level way to describe what money is, is to understand it as a physical representation of work. If you give money to someone maybe to buy tomatoes you’re exchanging the work you did to gain the money to buy them for the labour that went into the cultivating of the tomatoes. The interesting part to this though is there is no set amount of work to gain any amount of money, as the worth of labour is decided by the person hiring the labourer to do the work. With crypto currencies the labour that we pay for is usually the labour the computer that went through during the mining process. Like all currencies it is only worth something as many people agree it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitions
Cryptocurrency is a type of payment, a lot like cash or a regular currency. And a lot like regular currency, it can be exchanged online for goods or services, or plain swapped out for regular money. You can think about cryptocurrencies as arcade tokens for the internet, and you can get more tokens by playing games and winning them, or just waiting for them to be worth more. When you want to leave the arcade, you can swap them out for regular cash. It’s not quite that simple, but we’ll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different Cryptos
There are more than 13,000 individual cryptocurrencies traded online, for anybody to access. You’ve probably heard of a lot of the bigger ones, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and some of the meme coins, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. If you were to combine the value of all the cryptocurrencies on the market, it would come to an overall $2.5 trillion dollars. To put that into context, the current richest person in the world, Elon Musk, who from week to week is worth roughly $300 billion dollars, is only worth about 12% of this. Crypto is a rapidly expanding market, and we’re here to teach you about a bit of it.
F
Theory vs Volatility
Theoretically, cryptocurrencies are better than any regular currency. Using the advanced wizardry of Blockchain (we’ll talk a bit more about that later), cryptocurrencies are pretty much fully secure, since anybody can track any transactions that happen anywhere in the world. Cryptocurrencies are also a lot more accessible around the world, and allow people to transfer money in an easy and cost-efficient way compared to regular methods.In theory, cryptocurrencies are a lot more stable than regular currencies because they’re so secure, but that’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular currencies are managed by a single bank or entity, like the American Federal Reserve, which backs the value of proper currencies. Due to this, physical currency has a real-world value, which makes the value of the currency a lot more stable, and less likely to drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptos, however, only exist online via a sort of virtual agreement between all of the people that own some of that cryptocurrency. If more people buy in, the value goes up, but it can fall just as quickly. Crypto doesn’t have any real-world value, which makes it a lot more likely to go up or down quickly. If you put all your money into cryptocurrency, there’s no telling what would happen – you could lose it all or win big. Either way, most of the world doesn’t want to use cryptocurrencies as legal currency yet because it could cause some pretty big disruptions of the economy as a whole, tipping the scales a bit too far. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are really volatile, so you need to be careful investing into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing
https://www.amp.com.au/investments/what-is-investing#:~:text=When%20you%20invest%20your%20money,involve%20different%20levels%20of%20risk.&amp;amp;text=You%20could%20make%20money%2C%20break,your%20investment%20decrease%20in%20value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a step back, and look at how investing works as a whole. Putting cryptocurrencies aside for a bit, let’s have a look at how investing in regular stocks work. Investing in regular stocks tends to be a lot safer in terms of keeping all your money compared to investing in cryptocurrencies, but you don’t make as much money from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares
You’ve probably heard about shares before. When a company wants to get money fast, usually to start up a new project or get off the ground properly. Basically, if a company needs money, they can sell a percentage of themselves, offering people a share of the company’s profits in the long term in exchange for some money to start off with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain
Ok, so now we’re getting into the real crux of how cryptocurrencies work. Blockchain is, to dumb it down a bit, a fancy way of recording and distributing information, and it’s what things like cryptocurrencies are built off of. Blockchain is like a really elaborate shared excel spreadsheet with locked writing permissions, if that makes any sense. What I’m trying to say is that blockchain stores information in a really special and secure way, which is what makes it so useful; everybody can see every single update to the blockchain, and there’s a permanent record of any edits made. Alright, you guys ready to get into this? Let’s go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology has been around since around 2008, and when cryptocurrencies really started to kick off it became really prevalent really quickly. The goal of blockchain was initially to provide&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, blockchain is extremely useful for other things than cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading
&lt;em&gt;How trading works&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining
&lt;em&gt;how crypto is obtained: mining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;polishing-up-our-app-and-using-firebase&quot;&gt;Polishing up our app, and using Firebase&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the app in its final stages of development, we decided to dedicate this week to bug testing and patching any problems that might occur. Initially, this all occurred on the web version of the app, as both the testflight iOS beta version and the iOS app store version were both still under review. With the help of some friends who we invited onto the app, we managed to immediately find and patch a few duplication glitches that occurred in the buying and selling menus.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We quickly found that entering a value of 0 or a negative wreaked havoc through the system, giving users their inputted money back or allowing them to have as much money as they want. Fortunately, two simple lines of code containing inequality equations and an error message were able to prohibit people from exploiting our system.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The testflight beta of the app came out towards the end of this week. To our great excitement, our app worked flawlessly, with much better loading times in comparison to the web version of the app. It seemed so smooth and responsive! This gave us some very high expectations for the final app, which is soon to appear on the app store.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, since we host all our accounts on Google’s Firebase system, we were able to quickly reset any accounts who used the exploits while bug testing. Firebase has proved to be incredibly useful, and I’m glad we ended up choosing it over alternatives. We spent a while discussing what the best service to use was, and ended up choosing Firebase for its simple interface and free hosting, and ability to push updates to certain groups of people (for example, our beta testers with accounts using the @caulfieldgs domain). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually, the hope for our app is to migrate the large majority of the interface to being hosted on Firebase, so that we can push live updates and not have to wait for them to be reviewed as updates through the app store. Hopefully, this will provide a better user experience over all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- End Jekyll SEO tag --&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-been-a-while&quot;&gt;It’s been a while&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;woah. It’s really been a while since I last wrote a blog post. The last time I wrote, I had &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; integrated an icons api, hadn’t I?
That feels like ages ago… Well, even though I haven’t been writing much, that doesn’t mean I’ve stopped working on the app. In fact, 
I’ve made a whole lot of progress, which I’ll hopefully be able to summarise without going on for too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;graphs-suck-man&quot;&gt;Graphs suck man&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y’know how I said I thought I got the graphs working asynchronously? Well that was far from perfect. I don’t exactly remember much anymore 
but all I remember is that these graphs were being a severe pain. Essentially what would happen is that the graphs would load once with no data in them 
and then once again from the api, which was messing with things and making the graphs render weirdly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;/blog/static/mockup_5.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt; &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I remember, clearing the graph data wasn’t exactly simple. What happened is I got the data loading from Nomics just for Bitcoin, 
but the problem is, it would load inconsistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Dark Mode Screenshot&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Light Mode Screenshot&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/dark_semi_working_charts.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/light_semi_working_charts.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown above, it would load for some of them, but not for all of them. The worst part about it is that it wasn’t at all, and it would just only load 
half of the time. No matter what I tried to do with the other graphs, they would just be empty. Eventually, I figured out this was because of Nomics’ one second limit 
on their free plan. What I was doing was sending my requests, and it would reply with “hey slow down” but I’d try to parse that string as a graph and it would be empty. 
I tried fixing this for a bit, but as evident by this screenshot, that didn’t go so well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/angry_text.png&quot; alt=&quot;text conversation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me saying I went backwards referred to the fact that I thought I had solved the problem from the video, but after I tried fixing the 
problem from the screenshots, I had actually lost progress (somehow). Finally, after a lot of frustration, I slept on it. This 
proved to be very effective, because the next morning I found a way to use Flutter’s FutureBuilder to load the api call first, and then (and only then) 
render the graph widget. That resulted in a working graph integration for one cryptocurrency (still had to separate them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Dark Mode Screenshot&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Light Mode Screenshot&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/dark_working_charts.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/light_working_charts.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-icons-api-actually-wasnt-so-great&quot;&gt;The icons API actually wasn’t so great&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooooo, the whole last blog post was about integrating an icons api right? The one that I said was really really good and that I wish all APIs were like? 
Well, it turns out it has some limitations, which resulted in me getting rid of it completely (so much for all that time I spent on it :P). The issue is, 
and I have no clue why this happens, but sometimes their API just goes down on Heroku, and is up in a few hours. The project hasn’t been touched by them in 3 years, 
so I don’t understand why, but that’s the case. The disappointing discovery was that this is basically the case 50% of the time, and even when I started self-hosting, 
my bad wifi speeds meant that it wasn’t great (plus I don’t want a dependency that I have to manage). The solution I had implemented for a while was that it first fetches 
the coloured API for an icon, and if that doesn’t return something, then it fetches Nomics for the icon. The problem with this is, it actually has to wait for a response 
from the icons API first, which means icon loading takes longer than it necessarily has to. This combined with the fact that it doesn’t support many icons at all led to me 
deciding to phase it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;microsoft-store-submission&quot;&gt;Microsoft Store Submission&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALSO, I submitted the app to the microsoft store for review! It took them about 4 days to get back to me, but they sent this back:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/microsoft_submission.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit unfortunate, but I see where they’re coming from, because I said that the app educates, but at this point it doesn’t do that 
in any way shape or form. We’ll probably just have to wait until later, when the app actually has the features it says it has to create 
a valid submission. Either way, if we can’t get the app on the Microsoft store, we can always just have it as a website by itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;full-api-integration&quot;&gt;Full API Integration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I finished making the graphs all load from one source, the next task was to make them all load from different sources. This also proved 
relatively difficult, but I don’t exactly remember the precise issues I had with implementing this feature. All I remember is quite a few issues with 
the one second rule that Nomics has. I got it working by using the sparkline endpoint instead of the exchange history endpoint, and integrating that 
into my charts class. Works pretty well, and I was really happy once it was done! Screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Dark Mode Screenshot&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Light Mode Screenshot&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/dark_api.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/light_api.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;/blog/static/api_integrated.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt; &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loading times shown in the video were significantly improved on through some ~nifty~ optimisations, but really what I wanted was lazy loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lazy-loading&quot;&gt;Lazy Loading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazy loading, otherwise known as infinite pagination, is when you can keep scrolling infinitely, and you never reach the end. It’s like what YouTube does 
with their videos, where the feed never ends! This is apposed to normal pagination, which what google does, where you reach the end of the page and you
have to click to go to the next page. The latter is extremely easy to implement (it only took me like an hour), but lazy loading proved to be a lot more difficult.
The first problem was that I had written my code terribllyyy. My whole app was one big listview, and then my widget was a listview inside a listview (a bad idea I’ve learned), 
which meant that my project hierarchy stopped me from being able to access the position of the scrolling. In other words, because of the way Flutter works, I was unable to tell if 
you had reached the bottom, which is a pretty important part of lazy loading. The solution to this was pretty complicated, and involved the use of slivers. All scrollviews in flutter are made of slivers
(a listview is a type of scrollview), and they are basically very custom versions of a normal scrollview. Setting them up is a bit complicated, but it means you 
can fine tune them to do exactly what you want, how you want. Scrollviews and listviews are great, because most of the time they do what you want and don’t require much setup, 
but in this case, a sliver was needed. They really intimidated me at first, but I eventually figured it out, and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/The-NOVA-System/nova_app/commit/541e4734f7e064d5ce49d3dbe366e14ef8f73eae&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; 
commit, I managed to fully redo my structure so that the app worked like intended. This had some other positive side effects, those being that pull to refresh actually worked now (i had 
implemented it before, but since it couldn’t tell where the position was, it was just never called), and since it was actually programmed properly now, the widget listview could dynamically 
load and unload widgets when they were on screen to save computational power. This was a bit of an issue before, because when you switched tabs, the whole app froze for about 2 seconds, but now, since 
widgets have started being loaded dynamically, it’s much less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appending-to-the-listview-builder&quot;&gt;Appending to the ListView Builder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though I got the app coded how it should have been in the first place, actually appending to the bottom of the ListView builder was much harder than I expected. 
It was pretty easy to detect when you were at the bottom, but adding to a listview isn’t too simple. Honestly, I was pretty stuck, and every solution that I tried 
ended up failing for one reason or another. Listview builders don’t have a native append method, and the only array they come from is the future of the api call, which 
would have required me to create a stream. I tried a lot of things and a lot of things ended up failing. I eventually slept on it, and had a semi working solution. What it was 
a nested listview builder (one inside another), where the outer one increased in size by a counter, and the inner one was my normal listview. Whenever the normal listview loaded, it would increment
the page counter, so the next should have theoretically been on the next page. The problem was, it had a weird issue where instead of loading the next page, it loaded the exact same page again. 
I thought this may have been because I was incrementing the page counter and that wasn’t rendering properly, so instead I made it so I was modifying the future by extending it. 
For some reason, it still did the exact same thing. The more I messed with it, the weirder it got, where if I just swapped their order, somehow the “previous list” value was the future, but then if I did one of them 
by themselves it worked fine and AHHHHH. It made me go crazy, cause it didn’t make any sense at all. It still doesn’t make sense. The behaviour was fully unpredictable, which I disliked very much. 
Somewhere along the way, I realised I didn’t even need the outer listview builder anymore, so I decided to remove it. And then it decided to work?! I don’t know why, but that arbitrary change fixed it, and I’ll take it!
Suffice to say, infinite pagination/lazy loading works now, and it works wonderfully, so you can keep scrolling forever and always keep getting results :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot that I’ve done over the past week, and didn’t even mention any of the bug fixes that I’ve gone through. The API is officially fully implemented 
so the next steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a login system with firebase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a “detailed” menu where you can select the timeframe of the information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it so you can purchase cryptos with the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, up-to-date builds can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://nightly.link/The-NOVA-System/nova_app/workflows/flutter/main&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the MacOS version just fully doesn’t work as of now, but that should be all fixed when 
releasing the app. Have a good day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problem-with-nomics&quot;&gt;The problem with Nomics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in a previous blog post, the api of choice for this project is Nomics. So, today was the day when I decided 
I would start integrating the api into the app! Saying this, I found a problem pretty quickly, and that being that the 
sample data I had included something Nomics did not: colour information. So that I could render my graphs in a matching colour, 
my sample data included Material Palette equivalents of the colours of the logos. My first idea was to get the crypto logo (which 
Nomics thankfully did provide) and get an average colour to plug into the chart. I tried this for a bit, but the charts not working 
the best with async code made this a tiny bit difficult. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-wish-all-apis-were-like-this&quot;&gt;I wish all APIs were like this&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after a tiny bit of searching, I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptoicons.org&quot;&gt;really cool api&lt;/a&gt; that lets you not only fetch the 
crypto logo, but also specify &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; hex colour code so that the logo can be in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; colour you want. It’s honestly pretty cool, 
so what I ended up doing was using this api to fetch the logos, with a random colour from the Material Palette:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-dart highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;matColors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;charts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;MaterialPalette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;indigo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shadeDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;3f51b5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;charts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;MaterialPalette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shadeDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;2196f3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;charts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;MaterialPalette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;teal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shadeDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;009688&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;charts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;MaterialPalette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shadeDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ffeb3b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So essentially, it picks a random entry from that array above, and then uses the corresponding hex value for the api call, and the 
Material Palette value for the charts, etc. It’s a pretty neat system (which caches the images too), so now the logos + chart colours will 
always be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a bit of a derail from what I intended it to be, but honestly it was a pretty nice success with a very nifty API 
that I wish I’d found sooner. I think that there are 3 steps to fully integrating the APIs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Icons and Chart Colours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chart Information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest of the Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, all I’ll really need to do when it comes to the actual “information” side of the app is adding a detailed 
view for each of the crypto widgets. Progress is going pretty good so far, so hopefully I’ll integrate Nomics soon :D &lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;programming-is-so-fun-when-it-works-d&quot;&gt;Programming is so fun when it works :D&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after being relentlessly annoyed by how annoying computers were, I spent a majority of today working on the app, 
a lot of it during class time, but that’s fine since I finished all my other school work anyways. Anyways, the time and effort from 
today paved the path for genuinely working theming (yayy!!) &lt;br /&gt;
As I mentioned in the last post, I came across a solution that I managed to implement, but wasn’t working particularly well 
for me. What the solution suggested was to make the loading of the charts asynchronous, something which frustratingly, 
google charts doesn’t seem to offer within the package itself. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; say I gave up on this idea yesterday, but while in 
bed, I realised that this issue wouldn’t end here. Cause if the charts fail to load asynchronously, they won’t be able to load
data from the api at all (it’d just give me the same error)! &amp;gt;:( &lt;br /&gt;
Remember when I said this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;but it works for now and it’s &lt;strong&gt;not the main functionality of the app anyways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, well I was wrong. Loading from the API 100% is the main functionality of the app, and I didn’t want to have the same 
headache then as well. Sleeping me also realised that the bug caused by switching screens probably unloads the charts and
sets it back to the loading widget, but it never reloads the widget since the setState function isn’t called. 
Therefore, all I had to do was get back to where I was (probs should have uploaded to GitHub, more on that later), and somehow 
force that setState function to call whenever I switch pages. Woo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;but-most-of-the-time-it-doesnt-work-&quot;&gt;But most of the time it doesn’t work :(&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; right, in that the setState function was never being called, this much was true. The problem arose when I actually 
tried to call the setState function. My first idea was to just move setState into a void function outside the scope of the widget, 
and call it whenever I needed to load the chart. Unfortunately, Dart is nothing like Python, and actually requires you to have the
variables initialised in the function scope (who woulda thought). Soo, instead I fiddled around for a bit too long working out how to 
force setState to happen. Eventually, I did what I should have done in the first place and analysed the if statement, which goes something
like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dart&quot;&gt;if(!Config.isLoaded()) {
  Config.loadChartDataList().then((value) =&amp;gt;
      setState(() {
        //do stuff })
      }
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The if statement is checking whether the Config._loaded value is true or not, and if it’s false, then only will it load
the rest of the chart. This moment was a breakthrough, and with just a little bit of fiddling, I got it to run like this: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;/blog/static/mockup_4.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt; &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the theme toggling works perfectly, and you can switch from screen to screen pretty easily. I did spend the next 
few hours trying to implement a pull to refresh feature, but the widget for the wallets is non-scrollable, due to the fact 
that its parent is scrollable, so if it was you wouldn’t be able to go down. Therefore, the RefreshIndicator has to go on the 
parent widget, which is the root of the whole application, but if the onRefresh function is called there, it’s outside the scope 
of the whole widget tree and therefore updating Config._loaded does change its value, but doesn’t trigger the rest of the tree to 
refresh. This time for real, it’s not essential functionality, and though it’s probably possible with slivers or the like, it’s 
a bit too much effort for me right now (I should probably focus on the important functionality first). Besides that, I also added 
null safety support to the app which is neat, and the app should be your system theme by default!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through this, I realise that I probably should have started uploading the code to a GitHub repo from the beginning, so I don’t 
lose my code and have an archive of what it was before. So, after probably a bit too long, it’s all uploaded! You can access a pre-release 
version of the app &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/The-NOVA-System/nova_app/releases/tag/mockup&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, I’ve only compiled MacOS and Android 
binaries, but that should be enough for now. woop woop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a workflow that automatically build and uploads artifacts every time I commit to GitHub no effort on my side. So if you want &lt;em&gt;pre-&lt;/em&gt;pre-releases, go to the following link and click on your relevant operating system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;download-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nightly.link/The-NOVA-System/nova_app/workflows/flutter/main&quot;&gt;download link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much effort, we’ve finally finished the mockup phase of the app! We’ve got some very good groundwork laid for the future, 
and hopefully this can be done within 2 weeks or so, it will definitely be fun to use once it all is. Thanks for reading :))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- End Jekyll SEO tag --&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;todays-headache&quot;&gt;Today’s Headache&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s headache came from theming issues, woo! So essentially, I wanted to implement a simple dark/light mode toggle. 
I already had both the themes set out, so it should be pretty easy right? If only it were that simple… &lt;br /&gt;
There’s a pretty good &lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dev/packages/adaptive_theme&quot;&gt;flutter package&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly made the job pretty easy. 
I could have just used the built in theme and dark theme (which defaults to light and changes by the system theme), but I wanted 
to have a settings page that would make this a bit better, so I opted for the package. It was easy enough to set up, but then 
I witnessed the bug you can see in the video below: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;/blog/static/mockup_2.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt; &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really annoying, and honestly, I don’t believe it was entirely my fault, mostly just the way the google_charts 
package I was using was coded. This resulted in everything updating, but the charts breaking and giving me the error&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Failed assertion: line 120 pos 12: '_drawAreaBoundsOutdated == false': is not true.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched the error up, and the only solution I could find was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31778#issuecomment-593146310&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. 
Frankly, it works, and I was able to implement it too. The only problem is , when you switch to a different tab and then switch back, it stays 
on loading forever, and just never changes. I have no clue why it does that, but after about 6 hours of work, I gave up trying to make it work 
the way I intended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;/blog/static/mockup_3.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt; &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-dodgy-solution&quot;&gt;The Dodgy Solution:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, the solution I’m working on is pretty damn dodgy all things considered. Since it breaks the graphs if they’re 
on screen, but they work fine again if the page is switched, I just created a new settings page where you can’t see the graphs 
at all. This way, you change the theme, go back and it looks normal. Honestly not the most ideal solution, but it works for 
now and it’s not the main functionality of the app anyways. It was a pretty big waste of time to be honest, but at least we 
got some theming done in the end :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;yay-app-design&quot;&gt;Yay, App Design!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So continuing from the last blog post, I’ve been working on the app over the holidays. Even though I didn’t exactly get 
as much done as I wanted to, I have a UI mockup that I’m pretty proud of so far. The app is based on the wireframe below from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uplabs.com/posts/crypto-app-6a473389-202b-4cee-ad23-94cf46c172cd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/static/wireframe.png&quot; alt=&quot;wireframe&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Using some ~open source github repos~ (which are always useful), I have a little non-functional demo ready: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;/blog/static/mockup.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt; &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being programmed in Flutter, the same app showcased as a MacOS application here will target the web, iOS, Android and the Windows store.
It is mainly designed as a mobile app, so there may be some usability issues when it comes to that, but it seems to be working pretty well so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps should be pretty straight forward, as I’ve decided which API I want to use and just have to hook it up now.
The one thing I’m worried about is that Nomics may not offer graph data in the exact way I want it, so creating a “detailed”
view for each crypto may prove a tiny bit difficult. I’d rather not use one API for the graphs and another for the data, which
would kind of be a mess. I’ve asked a few people for feedback on the UI so far, and what I’ve got is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add the time period next to the crypto name (one day, one week, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add up or down arrows to green/red values on side&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remove brackets from value (can signify negative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main feedback has been the time period not being clear enough, so I’ll just integrate a default into settings which should solve that. 
Besides hooking it into the API, adding a login system with Firebase should be pretty easy. The main use for the account system in the app is 
just currency conversions from fiat to fiat (the one stored in the database will most likely be USD, while people here in Australia will 
probably use USD) as well as the leaderboards. Overall, progress is going well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;survey-time&quot;&gt;Survey Time!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, since we had to kinda rethink our whole idea, we were back at square one, trying to think of what we could do to 
provide the best educational experience we could. Being students ourselves, we have a pretty good idea of what we find 
to be engaging learning opportunities, but of course, if no one is interested in the first place, there’s no need for a 
solution. As such, we developed a survey, which a wide assortment of questions, gathering data on who our target 
audience is, if they’d be interested in our solution at all, and what the best way would be to implement said solution. &lt;br /&gt;
The survey was a big success, and we had &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.office.com/Pages/AnalysisPage.aspx?id=OoajI9NL6kSTKa8-6LxhU5UU__HeO21JoGtLFtk6isVUME1RNUlZSzQ2RjU1U082SElPNFpXVVNVTC4u&amp;amp;AnalyzerToken=CitlgZzIrK5XqCLonnoysAkW2eOQj2rJ&quot;&gt;many responses&lt;/a&gt;.
The main takeaway from the answers was that there’s a pretty large audience who would be interested in the workshops we intend to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;designing-the-app&quot;&gt;Designing the App:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been a bit more stagnant in terms of progress due to the lockdown and COVID, but I hope to make some good progress on the app over the holidays.
It’s a bit annoying that the lockdown’s going on for so long, since from experience, I can tell you that learning opportunities like this are a lot less fun when they’re remote.
To try to avoid this, we’re trying to prepare as many learning resources as we can in the time we have, and one of these includes the app. &lt;br /&gt;
As previously described, the app will just fetch current crypto prices, and allow you to virtually exchange ur balance for these cryptos, giving students a bit of experience with trading while not spending any money. &lt;br /&gt;
So far, I’ve found a promising looking API, which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://nomics.com/docs/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. All of the information for the prices is free and public, which can just be accessed as a JSON file as &lt;a href=&quot;https://nomics.com/data/currencies-ticker?interval=1d&amp;amp;quote-currency=USD&amp;amp;symbols=BTC&quot;&gt;such&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Over the holiday’s (which are running right now), I’ll hopefully get a good start on the app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;collecting-data-from-our-school-community&quot;&gt;Collecting Data from our School Community&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in moving forwards in our new idea is collecting data from our school community, to see how well versed people are in this type of field, and whether they’d like our lessons. We decided to specifically aim our lessons at our middle school community, who not only were more likely to be receptive to our lessons but also less likely to know about the economy, investing, et cetera. We formulated a fairly simple survey to get an idea of where peoples’ heads were at, and overall had a very encouraging response from our school community. Here are some of the statistics:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, we had 93 responses, spread fairly evenly across years 7-9. 72% of the people who answered our survey had some level of financial literacy, but did say that they would like to improve their knowledge of the general field our lessons would likely focus on.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
44% of people who took our survey had heard about cryptocurrencies on the news or social media recently, which we took as very encouraging – either news articles had peaked their interest, showing that they already liked learning about this sort of thing, or the posts they were being shown on social media were targeted posts from other things that they were already looking at.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The full break-down is available at: https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPage.aspx?fragment=FormId%3DOoajI9NL6kSTKa8-6LxhU5UU__HeO21JoGtLFtk6isVUME1RNUlZSzQ2RjU1U082SElPNFpXVVNVTC4u%26Token%3D692f10709c714c2ead97e66b5af13157
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the results, we’ve decided that our target demographic within the school community are the High and Very High brackets – the people who have visibly displayed their interest in our lessons. To cater our lessons to this group of people, we still feel the need to provide insightful and accessible examples and analogies about people, so that anybody attending our lessons can feel comfortable. We feel quite confident that we, once we finalise our project and have the opportunity to present it during middle school assembly periods, will have an enthusiastic audience who are eager to learn the skills we are there to offer them. Through this, we will be able to give back to our community and teach people some valuable life skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand if the middle school community would actually want in lessons and if they did want lessons what they would want to be taught we were thinking of making a Microsoft forms we can send to everyone in order to get results back in order to start planning out lessons. Here are some pictures of what we have so far. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-were-gonna-teach-people&quot;&gt;What we’re gonna teach people&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four main topics that we have decided to try and cover in our lessons, spread over four shorter sessions. This way, students will be able to pick and choose which lessons they want to go to, and we’ll aim to have as little possible cross-over information across the topics, so that nobody will feel out of their depth, or like the lessons have gotten ahead of them.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our four main topics will be cryptocurrency (covering what it is, how it works, what’s been happening with cryptocurrency recently), blockchain (its practical uses, how it works, why it’s so useful), the economy (a full breakdown on how it works), and flutter (our experience developing the app in flutter, a relatively new coding language).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our plan is for our lessons to educate students about cryptocurrencies and the technologies that support them. Both of these topics that have become increasingly prevalent as of late, despite not many people knowing how they actually work. We will be advising students about the dangers of investing in such a volatile sector, and not providing any financial advice per se, rather educating people about what cryptocurrencies are and how they are traded. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our lessons will include analogies about how cryptocurrencies work to make it simple for anybody interested to understand, talk about some of crypto’s prevalence in the news lately and how it’s impacting our society, give a broader breakdown of how regular investing and the economy work, the benefits of cryptocurrency over traditional currency, and the technological advancements made through blockchain. Hopefully these will give students a proper and balanced insight into the wider topics around cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-meeting&quot;&gt;The Meeting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on from the last post, we recently had a meeting with Mr. Philip Browning.
It was quite an interesting meeting, with a lot of topics discussed and questioned (and the conference room was really cool too like damn).
Philip essentially cut down straight to the chase, and the main feedback I personally took away from the meeting were 2 things. 
The first was that our idea was way too broad. There were way too many solutions we were trying to get at and the fact that it wasn’t fully established was a problem.
He also said that we were doing it the wrong way around. We had a solution, and then we were trying to find problems that it applied to. This effectively meant that in every case, our solution was not the most effective one out there.
He phrased it well. “Who cares?”. Who did we want to care about this, because if it’s not the most effective solution to a specific problem, it wasn’t very useful. 
He said we needed to find a problem, a very specific problem and get to know it very well. Only then can we come up with a solution to it. Therefore, we need to redo our idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reflection-and-revision&quot;&gt;Reflection and Revision&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team and I had a meeting soon after the one with Philip, and we came to the conclusion that we wanted to focus mainly on education. It was the easiest thing that could viably be done under the scope of a community project, and is a very specific problem that a very specific group of people care about.
Here’s the problem: people aren’t well enough educated about cryptocurrencies and means in which they can act as financial investments.
As I said before, we really wanted to find a “virtual crypto trading platform”, which would allows us to get familiar with trading at real world prices while not actually risking any money.
Our solution involves two elements, specific to our community. The first is to create an app which allows for virtual crypto trading as described above. The second is to hold workshops in the middle school to show people the backside of how cryptos work, because making informed investments requires a good understanding of how the underlying processes work.
All in all, this allows students to be well-informed about the financial side of cryptos, most likely the side that is most relevant to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-statement&quot;&gt;Concluding Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve basically restarted our project from scratch, we’re going to have to do a lot of work to get back to where we were with the last idea. We’re going to have to see if people are actually interested in something like this. We’re going to have to see what it looks like, whether it be a lunchtime club or workshops held during assembly periods. We’re going to have to get as familiar as possible with the problem as to create an effective solution. 
Needless to say, there’s a lot of work to do, but it’s a lot more focused now, and it’s easy to see the end goal when these few terms are over :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4th-august-2021-meeting-with-mr-browning&quot;&gt;4th August 2021 (Meeting with Mr Browning)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we had our meeting with Mr Browning. It was a fun and informative experience and talking about our ideas with him was quite interesting. However we’ve had to rethink our idea. I think Garv mentioned it as well but that conference room was pretty cool as well (that’s where we had out call from). After listening to our pitch of sorts Mr Browning had two main pieces of feedback for us. The first one being that our idea was too broad. We intended to create this whole new system as well as educate people on the economy and crypto currencies when those two things probably should’ve been their own community project ideas. He also said that we were sort of looking at the community project backwards and provided a personal anecdote about these fishermen and fishing equipment. I forgot what it was exactly but basically it was about him having a solution and trying to find a problem to solve it with. He related this back to us in that, we had the solution to problems however that solution would not be the most effective way to solve any of these problems. To quote Phillip “Who cares?” except for the people who are really into tech the project wouldn’t benefit anyone.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the meeting with Phillip our group had a separate meeting. We needed to change our community project idea, that was evident but to what? Each member in the group had wanted a virtual place to simulate cryptocurrency trades sooooo we decided to make one along with teaching lessons/resources (we haven’t decided yet). This benefits our school community as people can get better at using crypto and be more financially literate.  So that is what we chose. We also got a nice powerpoint template from Mr Heinrich that we are thinking of using at out classes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However getting to the point we had with our previous idea would take time and so we have to get working on it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;initial-concept&quot;&gt;Initial Concept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conceptualisation of this idea was born from the start of a school project, namely the Grade 9 Community Project. 
On the 15th of May, 2021, Natsuki messaged me detailing the idea he’d come up with, and quickly, the idea started to spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the year nine thing we coukd try and make an eco friendly crypto currency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(typo included and all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The initial concept was simple, one that had been implemented many times before, and we set our sights on producing a crypto similar to SolarCoin or NANO. &lt;br /&gt;
We also then detailed the other elements of the project, such as education, and called it a day, having a good few ideas as to what we could base our project around.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16052021&quot;&gt;16/05/2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natsuki came up with an idea: what if crypto’s relied on human work instead of computer work? &lt;br /&gt;
The idea was crude at best, implausible at worst, but needless to say, it was very interesting. The logistics and architecture were miles beyond what we as high school students knew, but if it was possible, it’d definitely be interesting. In a day where crypto currencies such as Bitcoin has a comparable amount of energy consumption as pakistan a year, using proof of human work systems would provide a better alternative to the inefficiency’s of such technology   &lt;br /&gt;
Over the next few weeks, we developed the idea further and found some resources with people thinking along the same lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-53644-5_20&quot;&gt;research paper that drove the initial concept&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;developing-the-idea&quot;&gt;Developing the Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around the start of June, we introduced Liam to the concept as well. It had the same impression on him as it had on us, and we spent a lot of time figuring out what this crypto was actually going to look like. &lt;br /&gt;
In the end, we settled on one idea, as described on the homepage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The idea was to design proof of human work puzzles for a cryptocurrency, which could serve as an alternative to current CAPTCHAs. This would effectively create a crypto with human miners, possessing the benefit of being better for the environment than most widespread cryptos, being less vulnerable to 51% attacks that small cryptos can frequently face, and generally being a fairer crypto that anyone could get into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To phrase it in layman’s terms, when you normally send someone money with a credit card, the bank gets a message saying “Garv is sending Natsuki 5 dollars”. 
Subsequently, the bank takes 5 dollars out of my account and puts in Natsuki’s. 
A collection of all these transactions is called a ledger. 
Now, with normal money, there is one entity (the bank) managing all the trades, which makes it very easy for them to get away with whatever they want. 
We don’t like big corporations, so the cryptocurrency was created. 
Instead of sending this information to the bank, a crypto sends it to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; on the network and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; acts like a bank. 
This means that if anyone wanted to just send themselves some more money, everybody else would be like “no you can’t do that”.
Our current system requires an inherent trust on big corporations, and cryptocurrencies allow us to take this into our own hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is where our idea comes in. Since most cryptos have to send their transactions to everybody, just for one transaction, a lot of computing power is needed.
As a hyperbole, if there were 7 billion people using the network, me sending Natsuki $5 would force &lt;em&gt;7 billion&lt;/em&gt; computers to process the fact that “Garv is sending Natsuki $5”.
This becomes very bad on large scales, where so much computing becomes terrible for the environment. &lt;br /&gt;
You’ve probably seen those things on websites that ask you to prove you are human. They require effort right?
Well the idea is to use all of this wasted effort to fuel a cryptocurrency, and as it is already using this readily available “energy”, it’s environmentally friendly.
Obviously that’s an oversimplification, but it expresses the basis of the idea, and with that, we aim to make CAPTCHAs less tedious.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem we have here is that we have to create a way to “fuel” a cryptocurrency that not only cannot be done by computers, but is publicly verifiable by a computer. 
It’s a bit convoluted, and we don’t yet know how to do that, so we’re in the process of contacting as many people as we can to tell us if it’s even possible. 
Obviously this is well beyond the scope of us as school students, but we hope to gather as many brains to help us achieve the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;Progress&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://timelines.gitkraken.com/timeline/912935f2f00c40589588a302beae453f?showControlPanel=true&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:90vh;border:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, you can see the timeline for our project. It was pretty easy to whip up a quick website to display the idea. At the time I’d been working on my school’s Maths Club Website, so porting the RSS/Atom feed over to this site was pretty easy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://garv-shah.github.io/maths-club-test/&quot;&gt;link if you want it&lt;/a&gt;). And now we have a website! I put quite a bit of effort into the documentation for the blog so check it out if you want to know more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/The-NOVA-System/blog&quot;&gt;Blog GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
We’ve also had a few chats with our Head of Learning Technologies, Mr. Heinrich, who’ll definitely be able to help us in our endeavours. He’s currently said he’ll contact Philip Browning. Philip works with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acornoak-studio.net/exploring-holochain&quot;&gt;Holochain&lt;/a&gt; and as he works with technology that is very closely related to our idea, we trust that it will be a great opportunity to take the project further. 
Besides this, we have contacted various people in this field, such as the people who wrote the paper linked above, and the creators of the Pi Network. So far, no responses :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-to&quot;&gt;Where to?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen by the timeline, we’ve just gotten to the point where we’ve established the idea. Now we need to contact as many people as possible to verify if this is even possible. 
We also are going to make sure not to forget about the other element of this project, namely education. For this aspect, we intend to develop a “crypto trading simulation”, which will use Coin Market Cap to create a Firebase database, which will all be presented as a Flutter app.
This is intended to help teach students about crypto trading, and we couldn’t really find an online tool that matches our needs, so we’re going to create our own! Presumably, Liam will be driving the education side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concluding-statement&quot;&gt;Concluding Statement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah so that’s it so far :D &lt;br /&gt;
It’s been really fun, and I can’t wait to see where this project takes us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Book of Moses Called&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter One&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
Genesis 1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Two&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Three&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:20 And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Four&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:21 And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Five&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:22 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Six&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Seven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Eight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Nine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:6 Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Ten&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Eleven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twelve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirteen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Fourteen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:12 And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king’s dale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14:24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Fifteen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their’s, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Sixteen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:1 Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:3 And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Seventeen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Eighteen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Nineteen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty One&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty Two&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:19 bsp; So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty Three&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty Four&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that were with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:34 And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:36 And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:44 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty Five&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty Six&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:15 For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:19 And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty Seven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:4 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:45 Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty Eight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother’s brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:4 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:21 So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 28:22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Twenty Nine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she kept them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:2 And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:7 And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:10 And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:12 And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:36 And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban’s cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty One&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:1 And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:33 And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:49 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty Two&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty Three&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty Four&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter: which thing ought not to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their’s be our’s? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:29 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty Five&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:8 But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty Six&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:10 These are the names of Esau’s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau’s son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau’s wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:21 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister was Timna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:28 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:38 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:39 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 36:43 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty Seven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:31 And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:32 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son’s coat or no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty Eight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:7 And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:14 And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Thirty Nine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:20 And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:7 And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:11 And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty One&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty Two&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:3 And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:11 We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:30 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:32 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty Three&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of their’s. And they drank, and were merry with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty Four&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty Five&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed them not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 45:28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty Six&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:7 His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were threescore and six;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 46:34 That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty Seven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:14  And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty Eight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:4 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Forty Nine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:9 Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Fifty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:15 And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy Bible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;8th-june-2021-first-in-class-learning-journeys-lesson&quot;&gt;8th June 2021 (first in class learning journeys lesson)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we ran through our initial idea with a form we had been given by our respective learning journeys teachers about authenticating a need as well as identifying a community to serve as well as the global contexts and goal setting for our project. Somewhere along the way Liam joined our group as well which was nice. He is more interested in the educating people aspect of the project rather than actually making it, Garv is fully into making the system and I am sort of 50/50 both ways. We also had a problem a few weeks ago where Garv was not sure if he actually did want to go through with the project as he wanted to try and remake/retouch/redo Caulfield life to make it looked better. I did not want him to leave as the project idea was definitely not possible with just me. He contacted Mr Heinrich (the head of technology at the school) if he could go through with the idea and talk about it with the higherups of the school. Well it turns out, making the app cost a ton of money (3 million dollars or so) and the school wasn’t about to get a new app for the same purpose anytime soon. So Garv was now stuck with me and we asked Mr Heinrich to be our mentor and he kindly obliged which was great. Mr Heinrich said that he would be contacting someone by the name of Phillip Browning. He is someone who works with people who work with holochain and is interested/invested in technology that is in the same lines as we would like to develop so that will be fun. We also started developing a timeline in which we can plan our goals for the project which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://timelines.gitkraken.com/timeline/912935f2f00c40589588a302beae453f?range=2021-05-13_2021-12-19&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also sent an email to the people who write the research paper asking for advice which can be seen under here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Dr Blocki and Dr Zhou, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I hope you are both having a good day.&lt;br /&gt; I am a year nine student at Caulfield Grammar School in Australia. After reading your paper on Designing Proof of Human-work Puzzles, my friends and I have decided to base our MYP community project around it. In this project, we have roughly five months to construct a project that is meant to align with our passions while benefiting a community. Our proposed project is to create or at least attempt to create Proof of Human-work Puzzles which can be integrated into the mining process of a crypto currency to make it eco-friendly. Through doing this, we also look to create a program to educate people on how this system as well as crypto currencies in general work focusing mainly on our peers at school. Although we do recognize that this project is quite ambitious, we would like to try our best. In the event we cannot create an integrable puzzle in time, we would at least like to help educate our peers on crypto currencies, as well as this emerging technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kind Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attached below is Mr Browning’s prior expertise sent to us by Mr Heinrich&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Recognised strategist and trusted advisor with over 20 years experience in building collaborative relationships for innovative outcomes across government, private and not for profit sectors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Adept and creative leader who seeks to draw out the potential of those around him and the opportunities he sees. Philip is by nature an orchestrator of people, ideas and resources. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Executive officer experience in the Non-Government sector, with strong private sector consulting and business development/marketing experience. This is coupled with extensive experiences as a trusted advisor and strategist across a range of settings within large programs (particularly at the very early business case and program establishment phases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A 20 year career, initially in Human Resource Management and then as a change manager and project director on large complex Information Technology projects (including ERP and HRIS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most recently worked primarily as a trusted advisor and strategist at board room, portfolio and program levels in large capital development programs including ehealth, social infrastructure and at the very front end of large organisational reform. This included the strategy and governance work that resulted in the creation of one of Australia’s largest health and human services not for profit organisations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Philip combines a broad range of experiences in strategy, policy, governance, strategic planning and business change to lead organisations to improved performance. He applies strong conceptual and analytical skills with the capacity to build collaborative relationships for successful strategic outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see it is pretty cool so we are quite excited to get some feedback from him and see what he thinks of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;here-is-a-problem-with-solution-hidden&quot;&gt;Here is a problem with solution hidden&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the largest prime factor of 51?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Click to show solution&lt;/summary&gt;
 (MARKDOWN NOT RENDERED INSIDE HTML TAG?)
&amp;gt; Answer: 17   
  
Let's use trial and error to see which numbers are factors of 51   
  
It's odd so we only need to try odd numbers:   
* 1 is a factor: $51 = 1 \times 51$   
* 3 is a factor: $51 = 3 \times 17$   
* 5 is not a factor   
* 7 is not a factor   
* 9 is not a factor   
     
And $9^2$ is already larger than $51$, so we don't need to try any more.   
The largest prime factor we found was $17$.
 
&lt;/details&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt; Answer: 17&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
 
  Let's use trial and error to see which numbers are factors of 51  &lt;br /&gt;
  It's odd so we only need to try odd numbers: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
  &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; 1 is a factor: $51 = 1 \times 51$ &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; 3 is a factor: $51 = 3 \times 17$ &lt;/li&gt;  
     &lt;li&gt; 5 is not a factor &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; 7 is not a factor &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; 9 is not a factor &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  And $9^2$ is already larger than $51$, so we don't need to try any more. &lt;br /&gt;
  The largest prime factor we found was $17$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is being written retroactively as when I sent this message to Garv the fact that we had to write process). This was the day that we started fleshing out the idea further and I came up with the idea that these cryptos could be mined using human work as opposed to the work of a computer. Garv was unsure about the idea at first but as we both looked into the idea further it started looking like a better and better idea. Through this process of delving deeper we found a research paper on the exact topic we were looking at linked &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-53644-5_20&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
We thought that if two university professors had looked into the idea it would at least be promising, and so we continued the journey with this idea. Mushc of the more technical aspects have been discussed ont eh NOVA system blog that can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-nova-system.github.io/blog/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem we have here with this idea however is that the crypto needs to be somehow fueled by the human work puzzles that would be filled in. We don’t know how to make this decentralized so we have to ask some experts on their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is being written retroactively as when I sent this message to Garv the fact that we had to write process). On this day I got the idea to send a message to Garv (“For the year nine thing we could try and make an eco friendly crypto currency”, with the typo included) regarding a community project idea. At this point in time the community project was only first announced and we did not know any of the specifics such as needing to have a mentor and the fact we needed to keep our progress written and recorded in the form of a process journal ect. I honestly have no idea why I chose this idea even when I did at the time. I guess I wanted to have a tech related community project as tech is one of my passions and I was interested in crypto currencies at the time, especially how they are mined as well the economic damage it causes due to the computer using a lot of electricity and the electricity coming from coal fire-plants. I also thought this project would be fun in that we would not be able to achieve our goal instantly, rather it would be a rather slow but equally rewarding journey.&lt;/p&gt;
